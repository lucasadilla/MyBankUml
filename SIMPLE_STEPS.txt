STEP-BY-STEP DATABASE SETUP
============================

STEP 1: Create the database tables
------------------------------------
Open Terminal and run this command:

mysql -u root -pPassword1 school_project < database/schema_school_project.sql

This will create all the tables needed for the banking system in your school_project database.


STEP 2: Verify tables were created
------------------------------------
Run this command to check:

mysql -u root -pPassword1 school_project -e "SHOW TABLES;"

You should see tables like: users, accounts, transactions, banks, branches, etc.


STEP 3: Compile the Java code
------------------------------
If you have Maven installed, run:

mvn clean compile
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies

If you don't have Maven, make sure you have the Lombok JAR in the libs folder, then:

javac -cp "libs/*" src/main/java/bank/*.java -d target/classes


STEP 4: Test the connection
----------------------------
Run this command:

java -cp "target/classes:target/dependency/*:libs/*" bank.QuickConnectionTest

If you see "SUCCESS: Connected to database!" then everything is working.


STEP 5: Use the database in your code
--------------------------------------
Your database is already configured with these settings:
- URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306
- Username: root
- Password: Password1
- Database: school_project

You can now use the Database class in your code like this:

Database db = new Database(
    "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306",
    "root",
    "Password1",
    "school_project"
);

if (db.connect()) {
    // Your code here
    db.disconnect();
}


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If Step 1 fails:
- Make sure MySQL is running
- Check that the database "school_project" exists
- Verify your password is correct

If Step 4 fails:
- Make sure you ran Step 1 first
- Check that MySQL is running
- Verify the classpath includes all dependencies

That's it! Your database is ready to use.
